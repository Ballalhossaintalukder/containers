# 1.32 version change log
{: #changelog_132}

View information of version changes for major, minor, and patch updates that are available for your {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} clusters that run this version. Changes include updates to Kubernetes and {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider components.
{: shortdesc}

## Overview
{: #changelog_overview_132}

In Kubernetes, most new beta features are disabled by default. Alpha features, which are subject to change, are disabled in all versions. For more information, see the [Default service settings for Kubernetes components](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-settings) and the [feature gates](/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-settings#feature-gates) for each version.

For more information about major, minor, and patch versions and preparation actions between minor versions, see [Kubernetes versions](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).
{: tip}

Check the [Security Bulletins on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Status](https://cloud.ibm.com/status?component=containers-kubernetes&selected=security){: external} for security vulnerabilities that affect {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. You can filter the results to view only Kubernetes Cluster security bulletins that are relevant to {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}. Change log entries that address other security vulnerabilities but don't also refer to an {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} security bulletin are for vulnerabilities that are not known to affect {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} in normal usage. If you run privileged containers, run commands on the workers, or execute untrusted code, then you might be at risk.

Some change logs are for _worker node fix packs_, and apply only to worker nodes. You must [apply these patches](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update) to ensure security compliance for your worker nodes. These worker node fix packs can be at a higher version than the master because some build fix packs are specific to worker nodes. Other change logs are for _master fix packs_, and apply only to the cluster master. Master fix packs might not be automatically applied. You can choose to [apply them manually](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_cluster_update). For more information about patch types, see [Update types](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions#update_types).
