# Why does the Ingress status show an `ERRICCNF` error?
{: #ts-ingress-erriccnf}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

[Virtual Private Cloud]{: tag-vpc} [Classic infrastructure]{: tag-classic-inf}

You can use the `ibmcloud ks ingress status-report ignored-errors add` command to add an error to the ignored-errors list. Ignored errors still appear in the output of the `ibmcloud ks ingress status-report get` command, but are ignored when calculating the overall Ingress Status.
{: tip}

When you check the status of your cluster's Ingress components by running the `ibmcloud ks ingress status-report get` command, you see an error similar to the following example.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
The Ingress controller ConfigMap is not found on the cluster (ERRICCNF).
```
{: screen}

The Ingress controller ConfigMap is missing from your cluster.
{: tsCauses}

Create the ConfigMap.
{: tsResolve}

1. Run the following command to create the ConfigMap.
    ```sh
    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM-Cloud/kube-samples/master/ingress-config/ibm-k8s-controller-config.yaml
    ```
    {: pre}
    
1. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, then check if the warning is resolved by running the `ibmcloud ks ingress status-report get` command.

1. If the issue persists, contact support. Open a [support case](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar). In the case details, be sure to include any relevant log files, error messages, or command outputs.
