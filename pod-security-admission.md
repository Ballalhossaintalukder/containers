# Pod security admission
{: #pod-security-admission}

Pod security admission implements the Kubernetes pod security standards that restrict the behavior of pods, providing warning messages and `kube-apiserver` audit events for pods that violate the pod security profile policy configured for the relevant namespace.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} version 1.25 and later includes support for Kubernetes pod security admission. For more information, see [Pod Security Admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/){: external} and [Pod Security Standards](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/){: external} in the Kubernetes documentation.

Pod Security Admission is always enabled for {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} version 1.25 and later. Earlier versions of Kubernetes use [pod security policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-psp).
{: note}

## Understanding security profiles
{: #pod_security_profiles}

The Kubernetes pod security standards define the following three profiles.
{: shortdesc}

Privileged
:   The default pod security configuration globally enforces the `privileged` Kubernetes pod security profile, which is unrestricted and allows for known privilege escalations, and generates warnings and audit events based on the policies set by the `restricted` profile.

Baseline
:   The `baseline` profile is a restrictive profile that prevents known privilege escalations. Allows the default (minimally specified) Pod configuration.

Restricted
:   The `restricted` profile is heavily restricted and follows the current pod hardening best practices. 

For more information about pod security profiles, see [Profile details](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/){: external} in the Kubernetes documentation.


Pod Security Admission contains three modes that define what action the control plane takes if a potential violation is detected.

enforce
:   Policy violations cause the pod to be rejected.

audit
:   Policy violations trigger the addition of an audit annotation to the event recorded in the audit log, but are otherwise allowed.

warn
:   Policy violations trigger a user-facing warning, but are otherwise allowed.

As security standards or profiles implementations change to address new features, you can configure Pod Security Admission to use a specific version of the roles. The following versions are supported.

- A Kubernetes major.minor version (for example, `v1.25`)
- `latest`

## What if Pod Security Admission isn't the right choice for me?
{: #what-if-psa}

While Pod Security Admission is always enabled, it can be one of multiple admission controllers. You can configure third-party Kubernetes admission controllers to implement other security policy models that suit your use case.

If you configure Pod Security Admission to enforce, warn, and audit by using the `privileged` profile, then the control plane allows all pods to run. You can then configure other admission controllers to reject them.

You can install a third-party admission controller as long as it doesn't take either of the following actions.
- It doesn't install its own pod security policies (PSPs).
- It doesn't rely on PSPs to enforce parts of the policy.

## Configuring Pod Security admission namespace labels
{: #psa-namespace-labels}

You can define the admission control mode you want to use for pod security in each namespace. Kubernetes defines a set of labels that you can set to define which of the predefined Pod Security Standard profiles you want to use for a namespace. The label you select defines what action the control plane takes if a potential violation is detected.

By default, {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} adds the `privileged` Pod Security labels to the following namespaces. These namespaces are labeled to `enforce`, `audit`, and `warn` by using the `privileged` profile.

- `kube-system` 
- `ibm-system`
- `ibm-operators`
- `calico-system` (Version 1.29 and later)
- `tigera-operator` (Version 1.29 and later)
- `calico-apiserver` (Version 1.31 and later)


Do not remove or change the labels for these namespaces.
{: important}

A namespace can be labeled to set the pod security profile for any or all the Pod Security Admission `modes`. 

For example, you can label a namespace to enforce the `privileged` profile in addition to using `warn` or `audit` by using the `baseline` profile.

This label allows administrators and application developers to dry-run applications by looking for only warnings and audit records against the `baseline` profile without rejecting pods. Then, you can make necessary changes to your workloads before changing the enforce mode to `baseline`.

The Pod Security Admission namespace labels are of the form `pod-security.kubernetes.io/<MODE>: <LEVEL>` and `pod-security.kubernetes.io/<MODE>-version: <VERSION>`.

- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version`

To label a namespace to enforce the `privileged` profile and generate warnings and audit events for violations of the `baseline` profile, use the following labels.

- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: baseline`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version: latest`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: baseline`
- `pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version: latest`




## Default Pod Security Admission plug-in configuration
{: #psa-plugin-config-default}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} uses the following `PodSecurityConfiguration` by default.

```yaml
apiVersion: pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1
kind: PodSecurityConfiguration
defaults:
  enforce: "privileged"
  enforce-version: "latest"
  audit: "privileged"
  audit-version: "latest"
  warn: "privileged"
  warn-version: "latest"
exemptions:
  usernames: []
  runtimeClasses: []
  namespaces: []
```
{: codeblock}




## Customizing the Pod Security Admission plug-in configuration
{: #psa-plugin-config-custom}


The cluster-wide Pod Security Admission plug-in configuration sets `enforce`, `audit`, and `warn` behavior for all namespaces that don't have pod security labels or exemptions.



For Kubernetes 1.24 clusters the `apiVersion` must be `pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1beta`. For 1.25 and later `pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1` is preferred, but the `v1beta` API version can still be used.
{: note}



1. Create a YAML file containing a `PodSecurityConfiguration` resource. You can use the default configuration to start.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: pod-security.admission.config.k8s.io/v1
    kind: PodSecurityConfiguration
    defaults:
      enforce: "privileged"
      enforce-version: "latest"
      audit: "privileged"
      audit-version: "latest"
      warn: "privileged"
      warn-version: "latest"
    exemptions:
      usernames: []
      runtimeClasses: []
      namespaces: []
    ```
    {: codeblock}

1. Make the customizations that you want to use. Review the following the information about each section of the configuration.

    `defaults`
    :   The `defaults` section of the configuration defines cluster-wide defaults for namespaces that do not have pod security labels. The fields can have the same values as the corresponding namespace labels.

    `exemptions`
    :   The `exemptions` section of the configuration allows you to create pods that are otherwise prohibited because of the policy associated with a specific namespace. Exemption dimensions include the following cases.
    
        - Usernames: Requests from users with an exempt authenticated (or impersonated) username are ignored. Usernames are typically IAM users or service accounts. For example `usernames: [ "IAM#user@example.com" ]`. You can also exempt the username associated with an `admin kubeconfig` client certificate. If you want to specify an `admin kubeconfig` certificate, the username is the `CN` component of the current client-certificate.

            ```sh
            kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{.users[0].user.client-certificate}'
            /home/user/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/mycluster-cheku1620qbs90gq6mdg-admin/admin.pem
            ```
            {: pre}

            In the following example, the username is `IBMid-27000xxxxx-admin-2023-05-12`. If you get a new `admin kubeconfig`, the username might be different.

            ```sh
            openssl x509 -in <client-certificate> -subject -noout`
            subject=C = US, ST = San Francisco, L = CA, O = ibm-admins, CN = IBMid-27000xxxxx-admin-2023-05-12
            ```
            {: pre}

        - RuntimeClassNames: Pods and workload resources specifying an exempt runtime class name are ignored.
        - Namespaces: Pods and workload resources in an exempt namespace are ignored.


1. Save your customizations YAML file.

1. Run the `ibmcloud ks cluster master pod-security set` command.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud ks cluster master pod-security set --cluster CLUSTER --config-file CONFIG-FILE
    ```
    {: pre}


When you run the `ibmcloud ks cluster master pod-security set` command, the  pod security admission is reset to the default configuration if you do not specify a configuration file.
